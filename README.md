In this project, we propose a reinforcement learning based autonomous driving system to control the 
motion of a self-driving car. For practical implementation, we work on a prototype of a car that 
has size equals 1/16 of a real racing car called Donkey car. The car is equipped with an RGB camera for scene 
capturing. The intelligent agent of the driving system uses the captured images to decide the 
appropriate motion of the car, and a control algorithm calculates the corresponding voltages 
to be applied to car motors. It is a globe desire to produce a self-driving car
that have the ability to be driven without human intervention. We aim to develop an autonomous driving system that would be responsible for 
safely and reliably controlling car motions in crowded roads and noisy environments.
